        <p><br><br><br><br>SCP designated 096 AKA "Shy Guy" <br>Object Class: Euclid <br>
Current Status: Containment Breach <br>
Description: SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height.<br> Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild<br> malnutrition. Arms are grossly out of proportion with the rest of the subject's body, with an <br>approximate length of 1.5 meters each. Skin is mostly devoid of pigmentation, with no sign of<br> any body hair.<br>
SCP-096's jaw can open to four (4) times the norm of an average human. Other facial<br> features remain similar to an average human, with the exception of the eyes, which are also<br> devoid of pigmentation. It is not yet known whether SCP-096 is blind or not. It shows no signs<br> of any higher brain functions, and is not considered to be sapient.<br>
SCP-096 is normally extremely docile, with pressure sensors inside its cell indicating it spends<br> most of the day pacing by the eastern wall. However, when someone views SCP-096's face,<br> whether it be directly, via video recording, or even a photograph, it will enter a stage of<br> considerable emotional distress. SCP-096 will cover its face with its hands and begin<br> screaming, crying, and babbling incoherently. Approximately one (1) to two (2) minutes after<br> the first viewing, SCP-096 will begin running to the person who viewed its face<br> (who will from this point on be referred to as SCP-096-1).

        <p2><br><br><br><br>SCP designated 173 AKA "The Statue"<br>
Object Class: Euclid <br>
Current Status: Containment Breach <br>
Description: Moved to Site-19 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173.<br> Personnel assigned to enter container are instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous object containment procedures. Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one is present inside. This is considered normal, and any change in this behaviour should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty. The reddish brown substance on the floor is a combination of feces and blood. Origin of these materials is unknown. The enclosure must be cleaned on a bi-weekly basis.
